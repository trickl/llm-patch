The document is a detailed report that examines the effects of nitrate pollution from agricultural runoff in an aquatic environment, focusing specifically on how it influences algae growth. The study was conducted by Dr. Emily Johnson and her team at GreenTech Labs to assess whether different fertilizer types (organic or synthetic) affect the bioaccumulation of nitrogen within a freshwater ecosystem in Lake Tahiti, where agricultural runoff from farmlands is causing an increase in algal blooms. The study was conducted over 5 years and involved monitoring water quality parameters such as pH levels (pH level changes due to fertilizer application on the river's edge of a lake near Riverton Lake using Python code for data analysis, with specific emphasis on how these factors influence fish populations in an aquatic ecosystem.
