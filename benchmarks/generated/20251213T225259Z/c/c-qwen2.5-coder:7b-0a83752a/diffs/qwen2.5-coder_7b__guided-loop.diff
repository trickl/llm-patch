{
  "interpretation": "The error is caused by passing integers instead of integer pointers to the `evaluate` function.",
  "explanation": "The `evaluate` function expects two integer pointers (`int *start` and `int *end`), but it is being called with integers (0 and `token_count - 1`). This leads to a type mismatch error."
