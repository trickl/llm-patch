{
  "interpretation": "The failure is due to an undeclared variable 'token' in the function 'evaluate_expression'. The switch statement does not handle the 'TOKEN_EOF' case, leading to a warning.",
  "explanation": "The variable 'token' should be declared within the loop where it is used. This will resolve the error and allow the code to compile successfully."
