  "interpretation": "A missing semicolon is causing a syntax error on line 41 in the `map` function.",
  "explanation": "The ternary operator's condition and result are not properly terminated with a semicolon, leading to a syntax error."
}
```

**Proposal summary:**
Add a missing semicolon after the ternary operator on line 41 to resolve the syntax error.

**Compiler error:**
ExpressionEvaluator.java:41: error: ';' expected
                        ? "0-" : token)

1 error

**Diagnosis summary (structural only):**
The compiler error indicates that a semicolon is expected after the ternary operator on line 41.

**Diagnosis rationale (discard after this iteration):**
The ternary operator in Java requires a semicolon at the end of its expression, but it appears to be missing. This causes a syntax error during compilation.

**Active hypothesis claim (must remain isolated):**
There might be an issue with the ternary operator syntax.

**Affected region mandated by this hypothesis:**
ExpressionEvaluator.java:41

**Expected observable effect if successful:**
The code should compile without errors.

**Previously recorded structural change (if any):**
Inserting a semicolon at the end of the ternary expression.

**Context:**
  36 |         if (inNumber) {
  37 |             tokens.add(sb.toString());
  38 |         }
  39 |         return tokens.stream()
  40 |                 .map(token -> token.equals("-") && (tokens.isEmpty() || tokens.get(tokens.size() - 1).matches("[\\(+-]")))
  41 |                         ? "0-" : token)
  42 |                 .collect(Collectors.toList());
  43 |     }
  44 | 
  45 |     private static Node parse(List<String> tokens) {
  46 |         Deque<Node> values = new ArrayDeque<>();

**Constraints:**
- Do not reformat unrelated code.
- Do not rename symbols.
- Change only within this method unless strictly necessary.
- Prefer the smallest valid diff.
