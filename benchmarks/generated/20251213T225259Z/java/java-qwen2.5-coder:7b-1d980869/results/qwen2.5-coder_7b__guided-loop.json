Describe observations and structural defects only.\n\nIf a compiler message mentions an expected or missing token, do not interpret this literally unless you can name \nthe concrete grammar rule being violated. Often the root cause is a different construct that leads to the token error downstream.\n When you believe the message is referencing a strict grammar construct, state the exact construct and why the compiler would flag the error at that reported location, even if you suspect the root cause lives earlier in the file.\n\nDo however, pay particular attention to the current token that the compiler is flagging as erroneous. \nPlay particular attention to the position of the error within the line and any significance of the previous and current tokens.\nAnalyze the current token's role in the surrounding code and grammar, and explain why it might be invalid or unexpected in this context.\n\nEnumerate at least four mutually exclusive hypotheses that could explain the observed failure. Treat the compiler message as potentially incomplete or misleading.\nFor each hypothesis, respond in plain English (paragraphs or bullet points) and include:\n    \u2022 A stable label such as \"H1\" / \"H2\".\n    \u2022 A structural claim describing the suspected issue.\n    \u2022 Evidence from the snippet or diagnostics supporting the claim.\n    \u2022 The code region or construct affected if the hypothesis holds.\n    * The position of the error within the line, describing the previous and current tokens.\n    * Do not write any code or diffs.\n    * Do not propose any possible fix or solution in words or pseudo-code.\n    * Do not propose any actions or structural changes, such as \"add\", \"remove\", or \"move\" code.\n    * Only describe a root cause that may manifest the observed failure.\n\nDo not return JSON, code fences, or tables\u2014use prose and simple bullet lists only.\n\nAfter enumerating the hypotheses, add a brief section that explains\u2014in plain English\u2014the intention of the code surrounding the error.

It seems that the expression before the ternary operator should be a boolean condition.\n**Evidence:** The ternary operator requires a boolean condition before the `?`. If the previous statement is not correctly forming a boolean, this could cause an error.\n**Affected Code Region:** Lines 39-41\n**Error Position:** Between lines 40 and 41, specifically after `tokens.get(tokens.size() - 1).matches(\"[\\\\(+-]\")`\n**Previous Token:** `)` (closing parenthesis)\n**Current Token:** `?` (ternary operator)\n\n### Hypothesis 3: Missing Parentheses in Lambda Expression\n**Structural Claim:** The lambda expression might be missing parentheses around the parameter list.\n**Evidence:** In Java, if a lambda expression has a single parameter, it should be enclosed in parentheses. If this is not done, the compiler might expect additional tokens.\n**Affected Code Region:** Lines 39-41\n**Error Position:** Between lines 40 and 41, specifically after `tokens.get(tokens.size() - 1).matches(\"[\\\\(+-]\")`\n**Previous Token:** `)` (closing parenthesis)\n**Current Token:** `?` (ternary operator)\n\n### Hypothesis 4: Incorrect Stream Operation\n**Structural Claim:** The stream operation might be incorrectly structured, leading to an unexpected token error.\n**Evidence:** The lambda expression inside the `map` method seems to be causing issues. It might not be correctly forming a valid Java expression.\n**Affected Code Region:** Lines 39-41\n**Error Position:** Between lines 40 and 41, specifically after `tokens.get(tokens.size() - 1).matches(\"[\\\\(+-]\")`\n**Previous Token:** `)` (closing parenthesis)\n**Current Token:** `?` (ternary operator)\n\n### Intention of the Code\nThe code is attempting to process a list of tokens.

Specifically, we need to ensure that the expression before the ternary operator is a boolean condition.\n\n**Structural Change:**\n1. **Change Location:** Modify line 40.\n2. **Change Description:** Wrap the entire conditional logic inside parentheses to form a valid boolean expression for the ternary operator.\n\n**Implementation Steps:**\n- Replace the current line with:\n  ```java\n  .map(token -> (token.equals(\"-\") && (tokens.isEmpty() || tokens.get(tokens.size() - 1).matches(\"[\\\\(+-]\"))))\n      ? \"0-\" : token)\n  ```\n\n**Explanation of Change:**\n- The ternary operator requires a boolean condition before the `?` symbol. In the original code, the expression inside the ternary operator is not enclosed in parentheses, which leads to a syntax error.\n- By wrapping the entire conditional logic inside parentheses, we ensure that it evaluates to a boolean value (`true` or `false`), making it valid for use with the ternary operator.\n\n**Effects on Surrounding Code:**\n- This change does not affect any surrounding code as it only modifies the expression within the `map` function.\n- The original intent of processing tokens and replacing hyphens under specific conditions is maintained.\n\nThis fix should resolve the syntax error indicated by the compiler, allowing the code to compile successfully.\n\nCompiler error:\nExpressionEvaluator.java:41: error: ';' expected\n                        ? \"0-\" : token)\n                                      ^\n\nPosition of error on line - previous token: identifier 'token'; current token: symbol ')'.\nIn the following snippet, the position of the error is denoted by  <ERROR> \n                        ? \"0-\" : token <ERROR> )\n\nDiagnosis summary (structural only):\n### Next Hypothesis to Test: Hypothesis 2: Incorrect Use of Ternary Operator\n\n**Structural Claim:** The ternary operator is being used incorrectly. It seems that the expression before the ternary operator should be a boolean condition.\n\n**Intention of the Code:** The code is attempting to process a list of tokens. It checks if the current token is a hyphen and if it's either the first token or follows another hyphen, plus or minus sign. If these conditions are met, it replaces the token with \"0-\". Otherwise, it keeps the original token. The result is collected into a new list.\n\n**Evidence:** The error message indicates that a semicolon is expected. This suggests that there might be an incomplete statement before this point. Additionally, the use of the ternary operator without a preceding boolean condition could also lead to syntax errors.\n\n**Affected Code Region:** Lines 39-41\n**Error Position:** Between lines 40 and 41, specifically after `tokens.get(tokens.size() - 1).matches(\"[\\\\(+-]\")`\n**Previous Token:** `)` (closing parenthesis)\n**Current Token:** `?` (ternary operator)\n\nThis hypothesis is worth testing because it addresses a potential syntax error that could be causing the issue.
