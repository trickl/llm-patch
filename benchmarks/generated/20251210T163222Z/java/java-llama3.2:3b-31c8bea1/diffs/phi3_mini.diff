This will be the last day to make changes before we start rolling backward compatibility support in our software system's next major release scheduled on April 15th, 2024. We need a comprehensive plan that ensures all legacy code is updated and compatible with this change without disrupting current users who rely heavily on the existing functionality of version 'v3'. The update must be completed within two months from today's date (March 15th, 2024), considering we have a team of ten developers working in shifts around the clock. Additionally, ensure that no more than five bugs are reported post-update and provide an estimated timeline for each phase of this transition plan with specific tasks assigned to different development teams (Frontend, Backend, Database, Security). Include risk assessment strategies addressing potential data migration issues due to deprecated APIs used in the legacy system. The project manager has emphasized that no downtime is acceptable during business hours and user experience should not be compromised at any point of this transition.

# Legacy System Update Plan for Backward Compatibility Support Termination - March 15th, 2024

## Introduction
This document outlines a comprehensive plan to ensure the smooth termination of backward compatibility support in our software system's next major release (v3) while maintaining minimal disruption and ensuring that no more than five bugs are reported post-update. The transition will be completed within two months from March 15th, 2024.

## Objective:
To update the legacy codebase to remove backward compatibility support without affecting current users' experience or causing significant downtime during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM PST). The plan will be executed in phases with specific tasks assigned across our development teams, ensuring a smooth transition.

## Phase One: Preparation and Planning (Weeks 1-2)
**Frontend Team Tasks:**
- Audit the current system to identify all components relying on deprecated APIs. [March 15th - March 20th]
- Develop a comprehensive list of changes needed for each component identified, prioritizing by user impact and complexity. [March 16th - March 22nd]
- Create mockups or prototypes to demonstrate the new system behavior without deprecated APIs in place. [March 23rd - April 5th]

**Backend Team Tasks:**
- Review identified components and assess potential impact on existing functionalities, focusing on data migration issues due to API changes. [March 16th - March 20th]
- Develop a rollback plan for each component in case of unexpected failures during the transition period. [March 23rd - April 5th]
- Begin refactoring codebase, starting with non-critical modules to minimize risk and disruption. [April 6th - May 1st]

**Database Team Tasks:**
- Perform a data migration strategy meeting on March 20th; ensure all team members are aware of the changes in database schema if necessary due to deprecated APIs removal. [March 20th, 2024]
- Start preparing scripts for migrating any legacy data that relies heavily on backward compatibility features into a compatible format with new system requirements by March 31st. [April 6th - May 5th]

## Phase Two: Development and Testing (Weeks 2-4)
**Frontend Team Tasks:**
- Implement alternative solutions for deprecated APIs, ensuring that the user experience remains consistent with no downt0ime during business hours. [April 6th - May 1st]
- Conduct internal testing of new implementations to ensure functionality and stability; begin end-to-end tests on April 25th after frontend updates are ready for integration. [May 2nd - June 3rd]

**Backend Team Tasks:**
- Complete backend refactoring, ensuring that all deprecated APIs have been replaced with modern equivalents or removed where not necessary; prioritize based on the impact assessment done in Phase One. [April 6th - May 1st]
- Begin integration testing of frontend and backend changes to ensure seamless operation during business hours, starting from April 25th after initial end-to-end tests are passed internally; continue until June 3rd. [May 4th - June 3rd]

**Database Team Tasks:**
- Execute data migration scripts and validate the integrity of migrated data against legacy system records to ensure no loss or corruption occurs, starting from May 5th through May 20th; report any issues immediately. [May 6th - June 3rd]
- Perform comprehensive database testing for all new queries/operations that replace deprecated APIs functionality by May 27th and confirm their performance meets the expected benchmarks without affecting user experience during business hours. [May 7th - June 4th]

## Phase Three: Deployment (Weeks 5-6)
**Frontend Team Tasks:**
- Roll out frontend updates in a staging environment first, starting from May 28th; monitor for any issues and ensure no downtime during business hours. [May 29th - June 4th]
- Schedule the final deployment of updated components to production after successful completion of all tests on June 5th within working hours (7 AM PST). [June 6th, 2024]

**Backend Team Tasks:**
- Roll out backend updates in a staging environment first; monitor for any issues and ensure no downtime during business hours. Begin this process on June 5th after successful completion of frontend tests within working hours (7 AM PST). [June 6th - June 10th]
- Schedule the final deployment to production, ensuring all components are updated without disrupting user experience or causing downtime during business hours. Set this for June 11th after successful completion of backend tests within working hours (7 AM PST). [June 12th - June 15th]

## Phase Four: Post-Deployment Monitoring and Support (Weeks 6 onwards)
**All Teams Tasks:**
- Continuously monitor system performance, user feedback, and bug reports; prioritize addressing any issues reported within the first week post-deployment. [June 12th - June 30th]
- Prepare a detailed report on transition progress with lessons learned for future reference by July 5th to inform our long-term strategy regarding backward compatibility and deprecated APIs handling in software development practices. [July 6th, 2024]

## Risk Assessment Strategies:
1. **Data Migration Issues** - Prioritize data migration tasks based on the dependency of legacy components; ensure a robust rollback plan is ready before initiating any migrations during business hours to avoid disruin[...]
