The error is caused by an invalid syntax in the first line of the file. The issue is a missing closing parenthesis at the end of the line.

Here's the corrected diff:

--- before.py
+++ after.py
@@ -1 +1 @@
- You areteacher meadowsthan, and I-
+ You are teacher meadowsthan, and I-

The diff only includes the first line of the file with the corrected syntax.
