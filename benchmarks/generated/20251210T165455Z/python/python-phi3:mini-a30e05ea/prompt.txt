        Problem: Expression Evaluator
        Description: Implement a mini calculator that tokenizes, parses, and evaluates infix arithmetic expressions with parentheses, unary minus, and integer semantics.

        Functional requirements:
        - Accept strings such as "3 + 4 * (2 - 1)" and return an integer result.
- Respect operator precedence (* and / before + and -).
- Support parentheses and nested expressions.
- Handle unary minus (e.g., -3 + 5).
- Split responsibilities across tokenizer, parser, and evaluator utilities.
- Provide minimal error handling for malformed expressions.

        Sample evaluations (write automated tests or a CLI snippet that demonstrates these):
        1 + 2 => 3
2 * 3 + 4 => 10
2 * (3 + 4) => 14
8 / 2 * (2 + 2) => 16

        Language-specific guidance:
        - Target Python 3.11+ with standard library only.
- Structure code into classes or functions (Tokenizer, Parser, Evaluator) rather than a single function.
- Add an `if __name__ == '__main__'` block that demonstrates a few sample evaluations.

        Output only the final source code for expression_evaluator.py. Avoid commentary outside of code blocks.
