# llm-patch

A robust, context-aware patching engine for applying unified diffs generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike traditional patch tools, llm-patch **ignores line numbers entirely** and instead uses fuzzy, context-driven matching to apply approximate or imperfect diffs reliably.

llm-patch focuses exclusively on one problem:  
**making LLM-generated patches apply correctly in real codebases.**

---

## Why This Library Exists

LLMs routinely generate unified diffs to describe code changes. While they are remarkably good at producing correct *content*, they are notoriously unreliable at producing:

- Correct **line numbers**
- Accurately matching **context blocks**
- Perfect alignment with **current file versions**
- Stable diffs across retries or refinement loops

Traditional tools (`patch`, `git apply`) assume diffs come from `diff` itself.  
They expect exact structure and precise numbering.  
LLM diffs rarely satisfy these constraints.

The result is a breakdown in agent pipelines:  
**valid fixes cannot be applied because the diff tool fails, not because the model is wrong.**

llm-patch solves this problem by applying diffs **the way an engineer would**—by analysing the textual changes and finding the best possible location for each hunk using robust contextual and fuzzy matching, not absolute coordinates.

---

## The Landscape of Approaches

A number of commercial and open-source tools have converged on similar ideas:

- **Aider** implements a fuzzy diff application mechanism to handle imperfect patches.
- **Cursor** integrates semantic code context when aligning LLM-produced edits.
- **GitHub Copilot Agents** internally use structural and AST-aware heuristics to resolve mismatched diffs.
- **Google's Diff Match Patch** provides approximate text matching, though it does not natively consume unified diffs.
- **AST-based frameworks** (Tree-sitter, Comby, etc.) provide structural transformations but are not directly aligned with the format LLMs naturally emit.

Across the industry, the problem is well-known, but **no standalone library** has been dedicated purely to:

- Taking LLM-generated unified diffs as input  
- Applying them **without relying on line numbers**  
- Using **repeatable, measurable fuzzy logic** to ensure robustness  
- Evaluating patching strategies against a **consistent, well-defined corpus** of test cases

llm-patch exists solely to fill that gap.

This is not a general-purpose diff tool.  
This is a **specialised engine designed only for LLM-driven patching workflows**.

---

## Approach

llm-patch implements a multi-stage hunk alignment algorithm:

1. **Parse unified diffs** into individual hunks.
2. **Ignore line numbers entirely**—they are treated only as weak hints.
3. For each hunk:
   - Perform **exact matching** of the removed lines.
   - If no match is found, perform **fuzzy matching** using similarity scoring.
   - Use contextual heuristics (before/after blocks) to identify the best location.
4. Apply additions and deletions at the highest-confidence match region.
5. Emit a patched file or return structured diagnostics when ambiguity exists.

This makes the library resilient against:

- Incorrect line numbers  
- Missing or loosely matching context  
- Whitespace or formatting drift  
- Edits to the file between attempts  
- Inconsistent or partial LLM retries

---

## Grammar-Agnostic by Design

llm-patch is intentionally **grammar agnostic**. It operates purely at the textual level and can be used with:

- any programming language,  
- markup formats,  
- configuration files,  
- or arbitrary plain text.

This ensures broad applicability across agent systems.

However, llm-patch recognises that **knowledge of a language’s grammar or structure can significantly improve resilience**.  
A future extension may support **pluggable grammar modules** or integration with syntactic/semantic analyzers (e.g., Tree-sitter, AST frameworks) to provide hybrid text+structure matching strategies.

The core engine remains lightweight and language-independent, while leaving room for targeted enhancement where domain knowledge helps.

---

## Systematic Testing Methodology

A core design goal of llm-patch is **repeatability** and **quantifiable robustness**.

The project includes a growing, **well-defined corpus of test cases** drawn from real-world LLM outputs. These test cases:

- originate from actual model responses (GPT, Claude, local models),  
- cover many failure modes observed in real agentic workflows,  
- are stored in a stable dataset for deterministic benchmarking.

llm-patch’s algorithms are evaluated by running against this corpus and measuring:

- whether the diff applies without error,  
- whether the resulting file matches the expected ground truth,  
- levels of fuzz required,  
- ambiguity resolution outcomes,  
- classification of failure types.

This produces a **quantitative, repeatable measure** of patching resilience.

Rather than relying on ad-hoc, anecdotal testing, llm-patch grounds all improvement in **systematic evaluation against a curated, reproducible suite**.

For a deep dive into how we will source, curate, and score hundreds of failing LLM diffs (including dataset layout, generator scripts, compiler gates, diff harvesting, and benchmark automation) read `docs/testing_strategy.md`. That document also covers the secret management expectations (via `.env` for keys like `OPENAI_API_KEY`), toolchain prerequisites, and the roadmap for the evaluation harness.

## A Research Test Bed for Continuous Improvement

The test bed is designed as a **living dataset** of real-world LLM behaviours.  
Its purpose is to:

- capture the evolving ways models generate diffs,  
- prevent regressions across algorithm revisions,  
- provide a consistent benchmark for comparing approaches,  
- and support empirical, data-driven development.

This avoids the pitfalls of:

- tuning against random samples,  
- overfitting to isolated examples,  
- or making unverifiable claims of robustness.

Every modification to llm-patch’s algorithm must demonstrate reproducible improvement across the entire corpus.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from llm_patch import apply_patch

source_code = """
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
"""

patch = """
def hello():
    print("Hello, Universe!")
"""

result, success = apply_patch(source_code, patch)
if success:
    print("Patch applied successfully!")
    print(result)
else:
    print("Failed to apply patch")
```

### Using PatchApplier Class

```python
from llm_patch import PatchApplier

applier = PatchApplier(similarity_threshold=0.8)
result, success = applier.apply(source_code, patch)

```python
from llm_patch import FuzzyMatcher

matcher = FuzzyMatcher(threshold=0.7)
source_lines = ["line1", "line2", "line3"]
pattern_lines = ["line1", "line2"]

# Find where the pattern best matches in the source
match_index = matcher.find_best_match(source_lines, pattern_lines)
if match_index is not None:
    print(f"Pattern found at line {match_index}")
```

## Benchmark Dataset Quickstart

- Problem catalog: start with the Expression Evaluator spec in `docs/test_cases.md`.
- Toolchains: install compilers/interpreters as listed in `docs/toolchains.md` (Java, C, Python, TypeScript, plus Ollama models `qwen2.5-coder:7b`, `llama3.2:3b`, and `phi3:mini`).
- Failure harvesting: run `python -m scripts.generate_failures --target-per-language 100` to collect non-compiling/incorrect samples (outputs land under `benchmarks/generated/<run_id>/...`).
- First-error diffs: run `python -m scripts.generate_patches --models qwen2.5-coder:7b,llama3.2:3b,phi3:mini` to ask the same models for minimal unified diffs that fix only the first compiler error in each case (diffs stored under each case’s `diffs/` folder).
- Patch evaluation: run `python -m scripts.run_patch_eval --algorithms git,diff-match-patch,aider` to apply every diff using the strict git pipeline, Google’s diff-match-patch, and the Aider-style matcher, then recompile the patched files and record per-attempt success metrics inside each case directory’s `results/` folder. Add `--markdown-report docs/patch_eval_results.md` (and optionally `--overwrite`) to emit a Markdown table that can be pasted directly into this README.

These artifacts feed the patching benchmarks described earlier so improvements can be measured quantitatively.

### Patch evaluation scoreboard

The evaluation harness now emits a Markdown table that breaks down each `problem_id × language` test suite and reports the three metrics requested per algorithm: how many diffs applied, how many of the applied diffs fixed the error, and the compound success rate over all attempts. Regenerate the report with:

```
python -m scripts.run_patch_eval --algorithms git,diff-match-patch,aider --markdown-report docs/patch_eval_results.md --log-level WARNING
```

The table is printed to stdout and saved to `docs/patch_eval_results.md` (ready for copy/paste). The latest run was produced from commit `6e12ca0`:

<!-- Auto-generated by scripts/run_patch_eval.py. Run with --markdown-report to refresh. -->
